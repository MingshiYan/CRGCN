#### Cascading Residual Graph Convolutional Network for Multi-Behavior Recommendation



This is an implementation of CRGCN on Python 3.6, Pytorch 1.9.0



#### Getting Started

first please check that the environment contains the packages in requirements.txt.

You can see the [Documentation](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_scatter) when installing _**torch_scatter**_ and _**torch_sparse**_ 


Taking the Tmall dataset as an example, after executing the method of generating data files in *data_process.py*, you can run Tmall dataset with:

`python3 main.py --data_name tmall`
